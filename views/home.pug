      h2 Offer a loan
      p At the heart of this service is our desire to see local businesses thrive. Members of self help groups are encouraged to meet on a regular weekly basis, to help members to keep their business and financial goals on track.  Umati service is being designed to provide a review portal for self help group members wishing to access small zero interest loans offered from their own groups as well as the international community.

      h2 Group Leaders
      p Umati Bank provides an accounting system for group leaders to use in tracking contributions to their group account. We do not hold money for groups, rather, we allow group leaders to report the weekly contributions, notify their members of their savings progress, and provide methods of tracking individual member savings, loan disbursements, and loan repayments.
